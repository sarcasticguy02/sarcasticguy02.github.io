    <p class="c5"><span class="c1">For my capstone project, </span><span class="c12 c1">Thing &amp; Fist</span><span class="c3 c1">, I focused on implementing many systems into the game. I created a lot of the foundational game mechanics in the first semester for most of the enemies and Thing's (one of the playable characters) gameplay abilities. I also programmed the UI and the menus throughout the game. This project was a year long project with collaboration with many other majors. Click on the link above to check it out more.</span></p>

    <p class="c15"><span class="c1">Throughout the development of </span><span class="c12 c1">Clockin' Out</span><span class="c1">, I was able to contribute to every aspect of the game. I was the gameplay programmer, I programmed the UI, and I created the enemy AI. I worked on this project for half of a semester as the only programmer, so I did most of the foundation code. Near the middle of the semester, I was able to onboard another programmer and we were able to work together to get the game to the stage it is today.
